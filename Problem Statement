Car dealerships lose customers but don’t know why.
🧠 What AI Does
Predict:
Will customer buy? (Yes/No)
If No → Reason Prediction
Price
Mileage
Brand trust
Sales follow-up delay


🛠 ML Skills Used

Decision Trees (explainable ML)
Handling categorical data


Task 1: Purchase Prediction
Binary Classification
Target: Will customer buy?
Yes = 1
No = 0

Task 2: Reason Prediction (If No)
If AI predicts No, it also predicts why:
Reason Code     Meaning
0               Price too high
1               Mileage concern
2               Brand trust issue
3               Sales follow-up delay
4               Budget mismatch

👉 This turns AI into a decision-support tool, not just a prediction machine.
